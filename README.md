# Jframework
a simple visual-basic-written framework that allow you to completely manage your computer, install packages, create codes and much, much more!!



Hi! This is my new project! i'm creating a new language the J#.

This framework will let you code with my language. what's the difference from others languages???

Is That J# CAN ADAPT TO YOUR MOTHERLANGUAGE!!!! let's see some examples:

                                to set  textbox's text in visual basic: TextboxExample.Text="whatever you want"
                                in J# English: text of TextboxExample= "whatever you want"
                                in J# Italian: testo di TextboxExample="quello che vuoi"
                                Note:the code might change in the release... stay informed here!
